# cryptography
This is simply a encryption and decryption program which encrypts the given string variable using combination of various encryption algorithms. It is hard to find the encryption sequence of those several encryption algorithms. Note : After encryption the length of string is not fixed. It depends on the algorithm consecutive sequence which changes at every instance of time.
